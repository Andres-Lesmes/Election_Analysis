# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
  In this project we are assisting a Colorado board of election employee in an audit of the tabulated results for the US congressional precinct in Colorado. Our task is to retrieve the Total number of votes, a list of the candidates who received votes, the total of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes for each candidate and which candidate won the election.
  
## Resources
  To accomplish this task we obtained the data from the file electon_results.csv and processed the whole data on Python 3.6.1. Then we printed the results of our calculations on a text file.

  * There were 369,711 votes casted on the election.
  * The candidates were: 
    - Charles Casper Stockham.
    - Diana DeGette.
